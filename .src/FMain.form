So using UbuntuCE will \nhave the same general look and feel as Ubuntu.\n\nAlong with the standard Ubuntu applications, UbuntuCE includes additional \nsoftware such as BibleTime, Xiphos, OpenLP, Host Minder, and more.\n\nHost Minder is an application that allows you to block unwanted domains \nfrom your system.
