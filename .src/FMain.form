So using UbuntuCE will \nhave the same general look and feel as Ubuntu.\n\nAlong with the standard Ubuntu applications, UbuntuCE includes additional \nsoftware such as BibleTime and Host Minder as well as full audio Bible in mp3 \nformat.\n\nHost Minder is an application that allows you to block unwanted domains \nfrom your system.
